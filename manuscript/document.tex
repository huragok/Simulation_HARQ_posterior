  all previous transmissions in HARQ system with statistical approaches. Our main
  result is that, unless the coherence interval (time or frequency) is large as
  in block-fading assumption, the posterior distribution of the channel and
  noise either remains almost identical to the prior distribution, or it
  follows the same class of distribution as the prior one. In the latter case,
  the difference between the posterior and prior distribution can be modeled as
  some parameter mismatch, which has little impact on certain type of
  applications.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
In our recent manuscript~\cite{wu2015modulation}, we studied the Modulation
Diversity (MoDiv) design problem for Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ)
Chase-Combining (CC) protocol. In this work, we approximate the bit
error rate (BER) based on prior fading channel and noise distributions after
each round of (re)transmission. One would argue that the need for the
$m$-th (re)transmission implies that all previous transmissions have failed,
thus the posterior channel and noise distribution would no longer be the same as
the prior distribution. Consequently, it is natural to wonder when and how the
posterior information, namely HARQ NACKs/ACKs, affects the channel and noise
distribution.

There are a few works highlighting this difference between the priori and
the posteriori
distributions~\cite{gu2006modeling}\cite{long2012analysis}\cite{alkurd2015modeling},
suggesting that adopting the prior distribution may lead to an overoptimistic
estimation on the performance of HARQ.
On the other hand, there are also abundant works about HARQ in fading channels
that do not consider the posterior distribution, such as constellation
rearrangement~\cite{harvind2005symbol}, power
allocation~\cite{chaitanya2014adaptive}, rate selection~\cite{jin2011optimal}
and so forth. As far as we know, it remains an open question
under what conditions it is suitable or not to exploit the posterior distribution.

In this work, we study the posterior distribution of fading channels and noises
in a practical LDPC-coded HARQ system under the general a priori assumptions of
Rician fading channel and circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG)
additive noises. By analyzing the posterior distribution with a series of three
hypothesis tests on numerically generated channel and noise samples, we
demonstrate that the posterior distribution may not significantly differ from
the prior one, especially when each HARQ packet, or transport block (TB) in LTE
terminology, experiences a few independent fading channel instances. 
Moreover, even when the coherence interval is large so that the instances of
fading channels corresponding to each TB are more correlated, the posterior
distribution may still follow the same type of distribution as the prior one
except for some differences in parameters. This minor difference has negligible
impact on specific applications such as modulation diversity (MoDiv)
design~\cite{}. To the best of our knowledge, the statistical approaches taken
by this work to study the posterior fading channel and noise
distribution in HARQ systems has not been reported in existing literature.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds} discusses a few
practical considerations why it may not be proper to adopt the posterior
distribution in the studies of HARQ system. Section~\ref{sec:model_data}
describes our system model and how we generate the fading channel/noise samples
corresponding to the posterior distribution for our hypothesis tests.
In Section~\ref{sec:tests}, we construct three hypothesis tests to analyze the
posterior fading channel/noise distribution. The numerical results are provided
in Section~\ref{sec:numerical}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes
this work.

\section{Backgrounds}
\label{sec:backgrounds}

One apparent reason why posterior distribution is not preferable is about
feasibility, as a posterior analysis for HARQ system is usually too difficult
unless one rely on some very restrictive, less practical settings and
assumptions. For instance, \cite{gu2006modeling} characterize the failure of
transmissions with effective SNR and rate criteria, which on its own is a
simplication and only numerical results are presented. Considering PAM
constellations and maximum ratio combining (MRC),
\cite{long2012analysis}\cite{alkurd2015modeling} attempts to explicitly
formulate the error probability. However, the error probability based on $Q$
function is an approximation, especially for practical high-order QAM
modulations, and their analysis is based on instantaneous CSI and does not scale
well for large number of retransmissions. In practice, a transmission failure is
declared by the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) when an error in the forward error
correction (FEC) decoding result is detected. Such a complex event is difficult
to characterize, let alone deriving a posterior channel distribution from it.

There is one questionable assumption common to all these works making use of
posterior information NACKs/ACKs. The channel corresponding to a TB is always
characterized by a single scalar effective SNR value, i.e. the entire TB
experience a single instance of the fading channel and/or additive noise. As a
practical example, in LTE system, each TB can be mapped to a maximum of 110
resource blocks (RB) of 0.5ms$\times$180kHz~\cite[Table 7.1.7.2.1-1]{ts36.213}.
In the propagation condition~\cite[Table B.2-3]{ts36.141}, the coherence time
could be as small as $\tau_c\approx 1 / (4 \times 300\mbox{Hz}) =
0.833\mbox{ms}$ and the coherence bandwidth could be $B_c\approx 1 / (2 \times
5000\mbox{ns}) = 100\mbox{kHz}$~\cite[Table 2.1]{tse2005fundamentals}.
Consequently, each RB roughly experiences independent fading components and the
univariate fading/noise instance per TB assumption is not satisfied. On the
other hand, if each TB experiences $N_{IF}$ independent fading channel
instances, then the posterior channel/noise distribution should be defined over
$\mathcal{O}(m\times N_{IF})$ complex variables, which easily becomes
intractable.

The generalization from the abovementioned restrictive settings and assumptions,
which facilitates a posterior analysis for HARQ, leads to the
second---more essential but less obvious---reason why posterior distribution is
not always worthy of exploiting: necessity. In the rest part of this work, we
will demonstrate that, in a more general and practical HARQ system, the
posterior channel and noise distributions may not differ significantly from the
prior ones, or the difference in distributions is too little to have visible
impact on certain applications.

\section{System Model and Data Generation}
\label{sec:model_data}

\subsection{Notations}
\label{subsec:notation}
We adopt the following notations throughout this work. $\Re\{\cdot\}$ and
$\Im\{\cdot\}$ represent the real and imaginary part of a complex matrix,
respectively. $[\mathbf{A};\mathbf{B}]$ and $[\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}]$ represent
vertical and horizontal concatenation of matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$,
respectively. Multivariate Gaussian distribution, 
multivariate CSCG distribution and chi-squared distribution with $d$
degree-of-freedom are denoted with $\mathcal{N}(\cdot)$, $\mathcal{CN}(\cdot)$
and $\chi_d^2$ respectively. $\mathbf{0}_l$, $\mathbf{1}_l$ and $\mathbf{I}_l$ denote the
$l$-dimensional all-0 vectors, $l$-dimensional all-1 vectors and
$l$-by-$l$-dimensional identity matrix. $|\cdot|$ and $\|\cdot\|_F$ represent
the deterministic and Frobenius norm of a matrix.

\subsection{System Model}
\label{subsec:model}
We consider a simple Type-I HARQ system with Chase Combining (CC) under Rician
fading channel and additive CSCG noise assumption. The received signal of the
$m$-th retransmission ($m=0$ represents the original transmission) is
\begin{equation}
  y^{(m)} = h^{(m)}s^{(m)} + n^{(m)}, \quad
\end{equation}
where $s^{(m)}$ is the transmitted symbols and
$n^{(m)}\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ is the noise. The Rician channel can be
modeled as~\cite{}
\begin{align}
    h^{(m)} = \sqrt{\frac{K}{K+1}\beta}e^{j\theta} +
    \sqrt{\frac{1}{K+1}}\mathcal{CN}(0,\beta)
\end{align}
where $K$ is the Rician factor, $\beta$ is the mean power, and $\theta$ is the
line-of-sight (LOS) component. We also assume that $n^{(m)}$ is independent
across different samples and $h^{(m)}$ is independent across different
(re)transmissions. Assuming all previous $m$ decoding attempt have failed,
after the $m$-th retransmission, the receiver makes another decoding attempt by
combining the $m + 1$ TBs received so far using a maximum likelihood (ML)
detector, until $m > M$ where the HARQ transmission fails.

\subsection{Data Generation}
To analyze the posterior distribution of the fading channels and
noises, we generate the channel/noise samples with a LDPC-coded
system~\cite{}. We assume that each TB contains 1 complete LDPC frame. Another
tuning parameter, namely the number of independent fading channels per TB denoted as $N_{IF}$, is added
to this system in order to test the impact of coherence interval on the
posterior distribution. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:model}, for different $m$, we
randomly generate a set of LDPC sessions, each consists of a encoding bit sequence and the
fading channel/noise samples corresponding to the $(m+1)$ TBs. The LDPC-decoder
then classify the LDPC sessions into two subsets based on whether the receiver
sends a NACK (decoding failure) or ACK (decoding success), which represent the
two posterior distributions we are interested in. 

Within each TB, the $N_{IF}$ independent fading
channel instances are periodically mapped to the $L_s$ symbols. Among the $L_s$
noise samples, we randomly sample $N_{IF}$ in such a manner that the
corresponding channel samples represent the $N_{IF}$ independent fading
channel instances completely. In this way we make sure that the number of
channel samples and that of the noise samples are the same. Consequently, within
each failed HARQ session, a total number of $(m+1)\times N_{IF}$ groups of
fading channels/noises are sampled. This groups of samples are then zipped across the
$(m+1)$ (re)transmissions to construct $N_{IF}$ records, each represented as a
$2(m+1)$-dimensional complex vector, or equivalently a $4(m+1)$-dimensional
real vector, in the form of
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{x} = \left[\Re\{\mathbf{h}^{(m)}\}; \Im\{\mathbf{h}^{(m)}\}; 
  \Re\{\mathbf{n}^{(m)}\}; \Im\{\mathbf{n}^{(m)}\}\right]
\end{align} 

In the next section, we carry out our hypothesis tests over a dataset of $n$
records of $\mathbf{x}$, which is organized into a  $4(m+1)$-by-$n$ matrix
$\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n]$. For notational convenience
we also decompose $X$ into four $(m+1)$-by-$n$ block matrices, i.e.
$\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{X}_{h,R}; \mathbf{X}_{h,I}; \mathbf{X}_{n, R};
\mathbf{X}_{n, I}]$, which represent the real and imaginary part of the channel
and noise samples, respectively.

  distribution of the fading channels and noises.}

\end{figure}

\section{Design of Hypothesis Tests}
\label{sec:tests}
In this section, we construct a series of three binary hypothesis tests to see
whether and on what conditions there is a significant difference between the posterior
joint distribution of the fading channel and noise and the prior one. The first
test examines whether the posterior data and noise samples follow the same
general type of distributions as the Rician channel and CSCG noise, i.e. whether
$\mathbf{x}$ follows Multi-Variate Normal (MVN) distribution. Once the MVN
distribution is verified, the likelihood of $\mathbf{X}$ can be evaluated,
therefore a second test could further verify whether the distribution of $X$ is
exactly the same as the prior distribution, i.e. whether the MVN parameters
such as the mean and covariance matches those defined for the prior
distribution. Should the second test fail, we fall back to a third test, which
checks whether the distribution of $\mathbf{x}$ suggests that the channel
and noise still agree with the i.i.d Rician fading model and CSCG model,
respectively, though with potentially different parameters $\sigma^2$, $K$,
$\beta$ and $\theta$ as the prior distribution. If so, the ML estimation of
these four parameters could provide some insight into the difference between the
posterior and prior distributions. These three hypothesis tests are detailed as
follows.

\subsection{Test 1: Multi-Variate Normality (MVN) Test}
The first test is literally defined as:
\begin{align}
  \mbox{(Test 1) } \begin{array}{ll}H_0: & \mathbf{x}\mbox{ follows MVN
  distribution.} \\ H_1: & \mbox{Otherwise.} \end{array}
\end{align}
Here we do not make any assumptions on the mean and covariance matrix of
$\mathbf{x}$. As there are a wide variety of MVN tests with different
characteristics~\cite{mecklin2005monte} which may well reach contradictory
conslusions over a same dataset, we adopt the the R package
`MVN'~\cite{korkmaz2014mvn} which in turn implements three popular MVN tests,
namely Mardia's test, Henze-Zirkler(HZ)'s test and Royston's test.

\subsection{Test 2: Parameter Matching Test}
If Test 1 accept the null hypothesis $H_0$, we can
perform a second test to see whether $\mathbf{x}$ is identically distributed as
the prior assumption. Specifically, assuming that $\mathbf{x}$ is MVN distributed,
\begin{align}
  \mbox{(Test 2) } \begin{array}{ll}H_0: & \mathbf{x}\sim
  \mathcal{N}(\bm{\mu}_0, \mathbf{\Sigma}_0) \\ H_1: &
  \mbox{Otherwise.}
  \end{array}
\end{align}
where
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \bm{\mu}_0 & =
    \left[\sqrt{\frac{K}{K+1}\beta}\cos\theta\mathbf{1}_{(m+1)};
    \sqrt{\frac{K}{K+1}\beta}\sin\theta\mathbf{1}_{(m+1)};
    \mathbf{0}_{2(m+1)}\right]
    \\
    \mathbf{\Sigma}_0 & =
    \mbox{diag}\left(\frac{\beta}{2(K+1)}\mathbf{I}_{2(m+1)},
    \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\mathbf{I}_{2(m+1)}\right) 
  \end{align}.
  \label{eq:mu0Sigma0}
\end{subequations}


The following proposition reduces Test 2 into a chi-squared test:
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:test2}
  Test 2 is equivalent to the following hypothesis test:
  \begin{align}
    \mbox{(Test 2(W)) } \begin{array}{ll}H_0: & -2\ln(\Lambda_2) \sim
    \chi_{2(m+1)(4m+7)}^2 \\ H_1: & \mbox{Otherwise.}
    \end{array}
  \end{align}
  as $n\rightarrow\infty$, where
  \begin{align}
    -2\ln(\Lambda_2) & =
    2n(m+1)\ln\left(\frac{\beta\sigma^2}{4(K+1)}\right)
    +
    \frac{2(K+1)(\|\mathbf{X}_{h,R}\|_F^2 + \|\mathbf{X}_{h,I}\|_F^2)}{\beta}
    \notag \\ &+
    \frac{2(\|\mathbf{X}_{n,R}\|_F^2 + \|\mathbf{X}_{n,I}\|_F^2)}{\sigma^2}
    - n\ln|\hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}| - 4n(m+1)\\
    \hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}} & = \frac{1}{n}(\mathbf{X}
    -\hat{\bm{\mu}}\mathbf{1}_n^T)(\mathbf{X}
    -\hat{\bm{\mu}}\mathbf{1}_n^T)^T,\;\hat{\bm{\mu}} =
    \frac{1}{n}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{1}_n,\label{eq:sigma_mu_ml}
  \end{align}
  in which $\hat{\bm{\Sigma}}$, $\hat{\bm{\mu}}$ are the ML estimation of the
  covariance matrix and mean of $\mathbf{x}$ from $\mathbf{X}$, respectively.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  See Appendix.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Test 3: Relaxed Parameter Matching Test}
If Test 1 suggests that $\mathbf{x}$ follows MVN
distribution, but Test 2 suggests that it is not identical to
the prior distribution, one would wonder whether the distribution of
$\mathbf{x}$ is still in a manageable form. A natural ``guess'' is that in this
posterior distribution, the channels and noises across the $(m+1)$
(re)transmissions are still i.i.d Rician fading and CSCG distributed,
respectively, except that the parameters $\sigma^2$, $K$, $\beta$ and $\theta$
are different from the prior distribution. In that case, we can examine the
ML estimation of these paramters to see how different they are
from the prior assumption, and whether certain applications are robust against
this parameter mismatch between the posterior and prior distribution. This test
is formulated as follows:
\begin{align}
  \mbox{(Test 3) } \begin{array}{ll}H_0: & \mathbf{x}\sim
  \mathcal{N}(\tilde{\bm{\mu}}_0, \tilde{\mathbf{\Sigma}}_0)
  \\
  H_1:
  &
  \mbox{Otherwise.}
  \end{array}
\end{align}
where $\tilde{\bm{\mu}}_0$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{\Sigma}}_0$ are defined as in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:mu0Sigma0} with $\sigma^2$, $K$, $\beta$, $\theta$ replaced by
unknown parameters $\tilde{\sigma}^2$, $\tilde{K}$, $\tilde{\beta}$ and
$\tilde{\theta}$, respectively.

Similar to Proposition~\ref{prop:test2}, the following proposition reduces Test
3 to a chi-squared test:
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:test3}
  Test 3 is equivalent to the following hypothesis test:
  \begin{align}
    \mbox{(Test 3(W)) } \begin{array}{ll}H_0: & -2\ln(\Lambda_3) \sim
    \chi_{2(m+1)(4m+7)-4}^2 \\ H_1: & \mbox{Otherwise.}
    \end{array}
  \end{align}
  as $n\rightarrow\infty$, where
  \begin{align}
    -2\ln(\Lambda_3) & =
    2n(m+1)\ln\left(\frac{\hat{\beta}_{h_1}\hat{\beta}_{g_2}
    \hat{\sigma}_R^2\hat{\sigma}_2^2}{16}\right) -
    n\ln|\hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}|
  \end{align}
  in which
  \begin{align}
    \hat{\beta}_{h_1} = \frac{\|\mathbf{X}_h\|_F^2}{n(m +
    1)},\;
    \hat{\beta}_{g_2} = \frac{\|\mathbf{X}_g\|_F^2}{n(m +
    1)},\;
    \hat{\sigma}^2_{R} = \frac{\|\mathbf{X}_R\|_F^2}{n(m +
    1)},\;
    \hat{\sigma}^2_{2} = \frac{\|\mathbf{X}_2\|_F^2}{n(m +
    1)},\label{eq:beta_sigma_ml}
  \end{align}
  are the ML estimation of $\tilde{\beta}_{h_1}, \tilde{\beta}_{g_2},
  \tilde{\sigma}^2_{R}, \tilde{\sigma}^2_{2}$, respectively.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  See Appendix.
\end{proof}

\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numerical}

\subsection{Simulation Settings}
Unless noted otherwise, we use the same simulation settings as
in~\cite[Section IV]{wu2015modulation}. For the LDPC code of length
$L=2400$ and 64-QAM modulation, each TB consists of $L_s = 400$ symbols. The
posterior fading channel and noise distribution is analyzed at $N_{IF} = 400,
100, 10, 1$ and $m = 0, 1, 2, 3$. For each pair of $(N_{IF}, m)$, we choose
$\sigma^2$ such that around 50\% of HARQ sessions fail and randomly generate
$n\approx 10000$ records of $\mathbf{x}$. Since MoDiv has little, if any, impact
on the hypothesis tests, in the data generation we adopt our MoDiv design
optimized at $\sigma^2=4.5$dB as in the coded-BER simulation
in~\cite{wu2015modulation}. The detailed simulation settings are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:settings}.
\begin{table}[!t]

\subsection{Hypothesis Test Results}
The $p$-values of Test 1 over all dataset are shown in Table~\ref{tab:test1}.
For $N_{IF} = 1$, the posterior distribution indeed appears to be of different
type from the prior distribution. However, for $N_{IF} = 10, 100, 400$, there is
strong evidence indicating that the fading channels and noises still follow MVN
distribution, this is especially true for larger $N_{IF}$ (100, 400) where all
the three MVN tests support the null hypothesis.

The $p$-values of Test 2 and Test 3 are shown in Table~\ref{tab:test23}. We
also listed the ML estimation results $\hat{\beta}_{h_1}, \hat{\beta}_{g_2},
\hat{\sigma}^2_{R}, \hat{\sigma}^2_{2}$ in Test 3 in comparison with the prior
parameters given in Table~\ref{tab:settings}. As we can see, for larger $N_{IF}$
 (100, 400), Test 2 suggests that the posterior distribution are likely to be
the same as the prior distribution. For intermediate $N_{IF} = 10$, although
Test 2 rejects the null hypothesis, Test 3 indicates that the posterior
distribution can be still viewed as independent Rayleigh fading channels and
CSCG noises. A closer look at the parameter estimation reveals that 
the posterior noise power is almost the same as the prior one. Also, the
posterior Rayleigh channel has smaller power than does the prior channels. This
gap in channel power is larger for $h_1$ than for $g_2$, and becomes smaller for
larger $m$. Finally, when $N_{IF} = 1$, despite the rejection of MVN hypothesis
so that Test 2 and Test 3 are meaningless, the ML estimation in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:beta_sigma_ml} still serves as the empirical variance of the
fading channel and the noises. The noise power is still almost the same as the
prior distribution, while the channel power is much smaller than the prior one.

\subsection{The Impact of Parameter Mismatch on MoDiv Design}
For the intermediate $N_{IF} = 10$, the hypothesis tests results suggest that
the difference between the posterior and prior distribution can be viewed merely
as a parameter mismatch in the channel powers. To see how our MoDiv scheme is
robust against it, we compare the MoDiv design based on prior distribution ($\beta_{h_1} = \beta_{g_2}
= 8$) and that based on a ``virtual'' posterior distribution ($\beta_{h_1} = 6,
\beta_{g_2} = 7$), and compare their actual BER performance over the posterior
distribution. The simulation results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mismatch}.
Despite that the gap between our virtual posterior distribution and the prior
distribution is larger than suggested by Table~\ref{tab:test23}, there is hardly
any difference between the MoDiv design based on the prior and the posterior
distribution.

\subsection{Remarks}
These numerical results demonstrate that, except when $N_{IF}$ is very small,
the posterior distribution conditioned on the failure of all previous HARQ transmissions is not so different from the
prior distribution, or this difference is too trivial to affect our MoDiv design
scheme. Note that our MoDiv design based on BER criterion does not make any
assumptions on $N_{IF}$ or the coherence interval. Instead we merely assume that
the channels experienced by multiple (re)transmissions of a single symbol $p$ is
independent. Also, we do not assume any FEC/CRC scheme or transport block
structure. Should we have used posterior distribution for BER
calculation, we would have to include more assumptions,
which would, inevitably and unnecessarily, make our problem formulation more
complicated, if not intractable.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This work investigates the posterior fading channel and noise distribution in
a HARQ system conditioned on all previous transmissions have failed, in the
context of modulation diversity (MoDiv) design for an Amplify-and-Forward
Two-Way Relay Channel (AF-TWRC) system. We design three hypothesis tests,
demonstrating with channel and noise samples generated from a practical
coded-HARQ system that, unless the coherence interval is large or the number
of independent fading instances per TB is small, the posterior distribution is
not so different from the prior distribution or the difference is so small that
it has negligible effect on our MoDiv design scheme. In response to a comment on
our original manuscript, this work supports the BER calculation using prior
distribution instead of the posterior one.

\appendix[Proof for Propostion~\ref{prop:test2} and Propostion~\ref{prop:test3}]
\label{append:proof}
The proof is simply an adoption of Wilks's theorem~\cite{wilks1938large}. The
log-likelihood of observing $\mathbf{X}$ under MVN distribution
$\mathcal{N}(\bm{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma})$ is
\begin{align}
  \ln(L(\bm{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma}|\mathbf{X})) =
  -\frac{n}{2}\ln|\mathbf{\Sigma}|-
  \frac{1}{2}\mbox{tr}(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}
  -\bm{\mu}\mathbf{1}_n^H)(\mathbf{X} -\bm{\mu}\mathbf{1}_n^H)^H) + C  
\end{align}
where $C$ is a constant. The parameter space $\Theta = \{(\bm{\mu},
\mathbf{\Sigma})\}$ has a dimension of $2(m+1)(4m+7)$. Its supremum
\begin{align}
  \sup \{\ln(L(\bm{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma}|\mathbf{X}))\} & =
  \ln(L(\hat{\bm{\mu}}, \hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}|\mathbf{X})) \notag\\
  & -\frac{n}{2}\ln|\hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}| - 2n(m+1) + C
\end{align}
where $\hat{\bm{\mu}}, \hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}$ are defined in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:sigma_mu_ml}).

Under the null hypothesis of Test 2, the parameter space $\Theta_0^{(T2)}$ has 0
dimensionality, the supremum of log-likelihood is
\begin{align}
  & \sup \{\ln(L(\bm{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma}|\mathbf{X})):\,(\bm{\mu},
  \mathbf{\Sigma})\in \Theta_0^{(T2)}\} \notag \\
  = & \ln(L(\bm{\mu}_0,
  \mathbf{\Sigma}_0|\mathbf{X})) \notag \\
  = & -n(m+1)
  \ln\left(\frac{\beta \sigma^2}{4(K+1)}\right) -
  \frac{(K+1)(\|\mathbf{X}_{h,R}\|_F^2 + \|\mathbf{X}_{h,I}\|_F^2)}{\beta} -
  \frac{\|\mathbf{X}_{n,R}\|_F^2 + \|\mathbf{X}_{n,I}\|_F^2}{\sigma^2}
  + C
\end{align}
therefore according to Wilks's therorm, as $n\rightarrow\infty$ 
\begin{align}
  -2\ln(\Lambda_2) &= 2\left(\sup \{\ln(L(\bm{\mu},
  \mathbf{\Sigma}|\mathbf{X}))\} - \sup \{\ln(L(\bm{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma}|\mathbf{X})):\,(\bm{\mu},
  \mathbf{\Sigma})\in \Theta_0^{(T2)}\}\right) \notag \\
  &\sim \chi_{2(m+1)(4m+3)}^2
\end{align}

Under the null hypothesis of Test 3, the parameter space $\Theta_0^{(T3)}$ still
has a dimensionality of 4, the supremum of log-likelihood is
\begin{align}
  & \sup \{\ln(L(\bm{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma}|\mathbf{X})):\,(\bm{\mu},
  \mathbf{\Sigma})\in \Theta_0^{(T3)}\} \notag \\
  = & \ln(L(\mathbf{0},
  \hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}_0|\mathbf{X})) \notag \\
  = & -n(m+1)\ln\left(\frac{\hat{\beta}_{h_1}\hat{\beta}_{g_2}
    \hat{\sigma}_R^2\hat{\sigma}_2^2}{16}\right) -
    4n(m+1) + C
\end{align}
where $\hat{\mathbf{\Sigma}}_0 =
\mbox{diag}(\hat{\beta}_{h_1}\mathbf{I}_{2(m+1)},
\hat{\beta}_{g_2}\mathbf{I}_{2(m+1)}, \hat{\sigma}_R^2\mathbf{I}_{2(m+1)},
\hat{\sigma}_2^2\mathbf{I}_{2(m+1)}) / 2$ and $\hat{\beta}_{h_1},
\hat{\beta}_{g_2}, \hat{\sigma}_R^2, \hat{\sigma}_2$ are defined in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:beta_sigma_ml}). Similar to the case of Test 2, as
$n\rightarrow\infty$
\begin{align}
  -2\ln(\Lambda_3) &= 2\left(\sup \{\ln(L(\bm{\mu},
  \mathbf{\Sigma}|\mathbf{X}))\} - \sup \{\ln(L(\bm{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma}|\mathbf{X})):\,(\bm{\mu},
  \mathbf{\Sigma})\in \Theta_0^{(T3)}\}\right) \notag \\
  &\sim \chi_{4(m+1)(8m+11) - 4}^2
\end{align}
